            <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>Born the son of a minor tax collector, Zhou became a tutor of a merchant family after failing the Imperial exams multiple times, bringing shame to his family’s name. He nearly died of starvation in a devastating famine during the reign of Emperor Xizong in 874 CE. A humble coffin-maker found him and, accidentally thinking Zhou was dead, attempted to prepare him for burial. However, he was interrupted by a group of pillagers who sacked his workshop and murdered him. Due to the burial rites not being properly completed, Zhou rose from death as a Jiangshi, the hopping undead. His lower body rigid and stiff, he is cursed to hobble throughout the land at the mercy of strangers, forever tormented by a terrible hunger for their qi. This is his story...</p>
