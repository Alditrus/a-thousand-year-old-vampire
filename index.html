            <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>Born the son of a minor tax collector, Zhou became a tutor of a merchant family after failing the Imperial exams multiple times, bringing shame to his family’s name. He nearly died of starvation in a devastating famine during the reign of Emperor Xizong in 874 AD. A humble coffin-maker found him and, accidentally thinking Zhou was dead, attempted to prepare him for burial. However, he was interrupted by a group of pillagers who sacked his workshop and murdered him. Due to the burial rites not being properly completed, Zhou rose from death as a Jiangshi, the hopping undead. His lower body rigid and stiff, he is cursed to hobble throughout the land at the mercy of strangers, forever tormented by a terrible hunger for their qi. This is his story...</p>

        <h2>Memories</h2>
            <h3>Memory 1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Out of gratitude, a lowly fisherman offers to serve me after I "cured" his daughter of an agonizing plague.</li>
                    <li>After the fisherman expressed his gratitude, I feel disgusted by the horrid rotting leech I've become and ashamed by the way I've taken advantage of others; I isolate myself from the other monks and never leave the monastary, continuing to feed on the dying.</li>
                    <li>One of the monks catch me in the act of feeding and I visciously attack and injure him; I flee with Gao across the waters to the island of Taiwan and adopt the name of Jiànhóng Li (907 AD)</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Memory 2</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>My best calligraphy to date was so beautiful, Master Chen almost passed out at the mere sight of it</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Memory 3</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>After failing the exams, my father threw my examination papers at me in anger; the disgusted look on his face still breaks my heart</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Memory 4</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I recite the poem Quiet Night Thoughts to myself while residing in the capital city for the exams to help me sleep, my heart longing for home</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Memory 5</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Due to tightening travel restrictions in response to recent rebellions, I am almost found out by officials at a travel checkpoint; after unsuccessfully using Confucian reasoning to get through, one of the clerks agrees to let me pass, for a price of course...</li>
                    <li>I am found out by another Jiangshi by the name of Tou Yong who steals my donkey Hui, although I put up a fight and gave him a nasty scar before he ran off.</li>
                    <li>Stranded in the Fujian province, a local Buddhist temple takes me under their wing as a hospice worker; when a wealthy donor's relative starts recovering, I ensure they die to keep the donations flowing.</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Diary</h2>
            <h3>Memory 1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hardly clinging to life, I hazily watch as the two thugs viscously beat the coffin-maker to death with clubs before I sink into eternal darkness</li>
                    <li>Having no one else to turn to, I drag myself through the streets until I reach Master Chen’s house; having compassion on me for my plight, he gives me one of his donkeys to help me get around.</li>
                    <li>To feed without detection, I pose as a traveling physician and “cure” the dying or terminally ill that I find; they’re on their way out anyway and the families are grateful.</li>
                </ul>
